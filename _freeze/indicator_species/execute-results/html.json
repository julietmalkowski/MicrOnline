This conditional probability is called the specificity or positive predictive value of the species as indicator of the site group.\nB- sample estimate of the probability of finding the species in sites belonging to the site group. This second conditional probability is called the fidelity or sensitivity of the species as indicator of the target site group.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAll the missing species from these groups occur because those species occur in sites belonging to all groups.",
